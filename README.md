# QB Softhand MoveIt! Config Package

The MoveIt! config package of [QB SOFTHAND RESEARCH](https://qbrobotics.com/products/qb-softhand-research/).

The default launch file [control.launch](https://bitbucket.org/qbrobotics/qbhand-ros/src/production-kinetic/qb_hand_control/launch/control.launch) in [qbhand_ros](https://bitbucket.org/qbrobotics/qbhand-ros/src/production-kinetic/) will include and start `robot_description`, `joint_state_publisher`, `robot_state_publisher` in default, which is not good to integrate with manipulator. So a new bringup file [qbhand_bringup.launch](https://github.com/lyh458/qb_hand_moveit_config/blob/seperated_bringup/launch/qbhand_bringup.launch) is created and used in this package.

If you want to use official bringup file, please try [official-bringup-devel](https://github.com/lyh458/qb_hand_moveit_config/tree/official-bringup-devel)

## Usage

- all commands are integrated in one launch file, just bringup qbhand and use Moveit! with the following command:

```bash
roslaunch qb_hand_moveit_config moveit_planning_execution.launch 
```

**note**: because the `device_name` of some files which generated by MoveIt! Setup Assistant is fixed as `qbhand`, to advoid mismatching error, the arg `device_name` is a hardcode and fixed as `qbhand`. You can set the qbhand's namespace with the option `robot_namespace`, eg. `robot_namespace:=qbhand_ns`. Other more options please checkup the launch file.

## TODO

- [ ] gazebo simulation supported.
